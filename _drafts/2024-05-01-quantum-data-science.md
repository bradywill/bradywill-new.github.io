excerpt: 'A recent paper on quantum computing.'
---

This week, I came across the recently published paper ["An introduction to quantum computing for statisticians and data scientists"](https://www.aimsciences.org//article/doi/10.3934/fods.2024013) from Lopatnikova and Tran, in collaboration with my former research supervisor [Scott Sisson](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/).

> This review aims to provide an introduction to quantum computing accessible to statisticians and data scientists, equipping them with a comprehensive framework, the basic language, and building blocks of quantum algorithms, as well as an overview of existing quantum applications in statistics and data analysis.

I'm a Data Scientist with a developing interest in quantum physics, so this paper seems to be aimed squarely at me.

> Quantum computing [is] currently in the state of development reminiscent of classical transistor-based computers in the 1940s.

This is a fun idea to consider. Maybe in roughly 50 years, we'll all have quantum personal computers. With what I know about quantum computing and its current capabilities, that doesn't seem likely. Then again, few in the 1940s would have predicted the personal computer being so widespread in the 1990s.

### Quantum theory

> At the level of single atoms, nature is probabilistic.
> 
> Figuratively speaking, what we experience in our everyday lives are large-sample properties of quantum theory.

These statements are a concise description of what fascinates me about quantum theory.

> The core of quantum theory is linear algebra on complex vector spaces, called Hilbert spaces
> 
> Any closed quantum system can be described as a vector in a Hilbert space.
> 
> This vector, called a pure quantum state, is denoted as $$ \vert \psi \rangle $$
> 
> The quantum state can be written as a linear combination of basis vectors, which are also quantum
states -- i.e. vectors in the Hilbert space.
> 
> A linear combination of quantum states is called a quantum superposition.

A quantum state is a linear combination of basis vectors in Hibert space, and quantum superposition is just a linear combination of those. Conceptually straightforward, but not quite simple mental math.

[Hilbert space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space) extends Euclidean vector space to more than three dimensions.

### Future reading?

> The library of quantum algorithms is growing, encompassing efficient solutions to [...] machine learning models [52] [...] and other methods of interest to statisticians and data scientists [138]

> Reviews of quantum science and technology for statisticians have become recently available [163, 162]

> An extended version of this review [102] discusses quantum algorithms and their building blocks
in greater detail.
