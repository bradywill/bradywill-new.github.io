excerpt: 'Some late night musings on a humble card game.'

My family bought its first computer when I was quite young.

I don't remember the exact year, but I do remember it had an [Intel 486](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I486) processor and that the [Pentium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_(original)) processor came out shortly after. Wikipedia tells me this puts it between 1989 and 1993. It had [Windows 3.1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.1), which was released in 1992, so that seems like a decent bet. It also had a staggering 8 MB of RAM.

I remember playing a lot of [Solitaire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Solitaire) on that computer.

32 years later, I'm using Ubuntu 22.04 via a virtual machine on Windows 10 on a 9600K with 32GB of RAM. I got a real kick out of GNOME games still being bundled with Ubuntu, because it has [Aisleriot](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Aisleriot). I'm not proud of how many games of [Klondike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klondike_(solitaire)) I've played since discovering that information.

Windows Solitaire was [a big deal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1994/03/09/office-minefield/3b74132a-5f0a-455f-a04e-6171d023149b/).

I thought this was just a funny little quote from the local area nerd, then I got curious and looked up [the MetaNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Meta_Network).

Hey, there's our boy! And, look, he's even got his own [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_L._Burns).

> As an Army officer, Burns served two tours in Vietnam (Silver Star, Bronze Star with 2 OLCs). He created the military recruitment slogan "Be All That You Can Be" in 1980 and was director of "Task Force Delta" (an ad hoc working group of 300 U.S. Army psychic adepts that met quarterly at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas) beginning in 1983.

Yes, that's right. Frank Burns, shown here commenting on Windows games in the workplace, previously led the US military psychic research group in the 1980s of [The Men Who Stare at Goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Stare_at_Goats) infamy.

That might be enough Internet for today. I think I'll go play a game of cards.
