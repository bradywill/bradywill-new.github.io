Hello.

I'm Brady.

I'm a Data Scientist at Amazon in Seattle. For the last six years, I've been working on the machine learning and data science behind forecasting customer demand for everything sold on Amazon websites and in stores worldwide. My team is part of the [Supply Chain Optimization Technologies (SCOT)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncwsr1Of6Cw) organization. You can see some of the work I've done at [amazon.science](https://www.amazon.science/publications/distribution-free-multi-horizon-forecasting-and-vending-system).

Before Amazon, I spent three years as a Quantitative Analyst at Westpac Bank in Sydney developing credit risk models, while also completing my Master's degree in Statistics from University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney. At UNSW, I conducted research into autoregressive modelling of histograms and probability distributions with [Dr. Scott Sisson](https://web.maths.unsw.edu.au/~scott/).

I received my Bachelor's and [Honours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honours_degree#Australia) degrees in Commerce (majoring in Economics and Finance) from Monash University in Gippsland, Victoria. At Monash, I conducted research into the impact of consumer and business sentiment on financial and economic activity in Australia with [Dr. Ernesto Valenzuela](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/evalenzuela).
